# Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions to help us improve this project. THANK YOU.  Great documentation is critical to a project but sadly often lacking. 

### Workflow:

1.  [Fork the FitHome-docs repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2.  Create a branch (git checkout -b my-branch)
3.  Stage and commit your changes (git commit -am 'description of my changes')
4.  Push the changes to your fork (git push origin my-branch)
5.  [Submit a pull request to the parent repo](TBD)

If you're new to using Git, [the GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/) are quite useful.

And of course you can always email us: [contact@fithome.life](mailto:contact@fithome.life`).
